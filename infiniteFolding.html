    <h1>Infinite Folds.</h1>
    <p>
      You may come across the phrase <span style="font-style: italic;">"foldr works on infinite lists but not
      foldl." </span> Well that seems strange for a couple reasons.
      <ol type="a">
          <li>
        Why would you ever try to fold up an infite list? Wouldn't it always
    take forever no matter which way you fold?  
      </li>
      <li>Why would it matter which way
        you fold? It's still infinite!</li></ol>
    </p>
     <p>Let's explore.</p>     
     <p>First, an exercise for the reader: Recall the types of foldl and foldr.
      I'm going to put them below,
    but try to do this on your own before you look.
    </p>
    <div class="accordion" id="accordionExample">
                <button class=" mb-0 btn btn-link" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseOne">
                  Show foldr/foldl types
                </button>
            <div id="collapseOne" class="collapse" data-parent="#accordionExample">
<pre ><code >foldl :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b 

foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
</code></pre>
                    
            </div>
    </div>
        
     <p >
       **Note that we're
      defining foldl/r specific for lists. The real foldl/r type works on any
      structure that is "Foldable".
     </p> 
     <p >
       The types are almost identical. And indeed
      there are severe similarities between foldl and foldr. They both go over an
      entire list to create some new value from all the values in the list. You
      have to give foldl and foldr 3 things:
     </p> 
     <ol><li>A function. How do I combine the
        current "accumulating" value with an element of the list to get a new
        accumulated value? For example, if you wanted to check that every character
        in a string was numeric a good function to pass foldl would be: (\acc c ->
        acc && ( c `elem` ['0'..'9'])). The final value we want is a Bool. This
        function takes whatever the current true/false state is and combines it with
        a char to give a new current state. If at any point a char is not a digit,
        the false will carry through all the way till the end. aka True && False &&
        True && True && True && True = False. Anyway, our types line up. (Bool ->
        Char -> Bool) matches (b -> a -> b), So we'd be in good shape.</li>
      <li>An initial
          accumulation value. For example, if you are summing up a list of numbers,
          you would give 0 as your starting value. If you were checking if all chars
          in a string are digits, you would start with True (and wait for a char to
          break it).</li>
          <li>The list to be folded. AKA The list to iterate through. e.g.
              "8584h"</li>
    </ol>  There are two differences between foldl and foldr:
    <ol>
      <li>In the
          function we pass to foldl/r that combines the accumulating value and an
          element of the list, acc is the first (or on the left side) parameter and
          acc is the second (or right side) parameter for foldr. A nit-picky
          difference.</li>
          <li>foldl begins on the left side of the list. foldr starts on
              the right side.</li>
    </ol> 
    <p >
      Now that we are a bit re-familiarized with folds, let's look
      at an example of why you might do a fold using an infinite list. You would,
      of course, be correct to say that something like <code>foldr (+) [1..] 0</code> or 
      <code >foldl (+) [1..] 0</code> would both take a literal forever. But let's say wanted a
      function that gives you the sum of all Integers up to a given number.
    </p> Here's
    a straightforward implementation: 
    <pre ><code >sumUpTo :: Int -> Int 
sumUpTo n = sum [1..n]</code></pre>
    A more interesting way: 
    <pre ><code>sumUpTo' :: Int -> Int 
sumUpTo' n = let listOfSums = foldr (\x acc -> sum [0..x] : acc ) [] [0..] in 
    listofSums !! n
    </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      A bit roundabout and inefficient, but interesting and serves as a simple
    example of how one could find use in folding an infinte list. We fold over
    an infinite list to <i>create</i> a list. listOfSums is a list where each element
    is a sum of the ints up to its index.</p> 
    <p>
    Here are the first ten elements of
    listOfSums: <code>[0,1,3,6,10,15,21,28,36,45]</code>.</p> 
    
    <p>Once we define this list, we simply
    have to access the corresponding index. No other thinking needed. It was
    very important that we chose foldr instead of foldl to do this. Wait a
    second--if anything, it seems like the reverse would be true! Why would
    starting on the right side which would be INFINITY of an infinite list work,
    but starting at the known 0 side would end up taking ininite time? There is
    not another way to understand this than to look at how foldl and foldr work
    under the hood.</p> 
    Excersie: Define foldl. Recall: <code>foldl :: (b -> a -> b) -> b
    -> [a] -> b</code> 
    Additionally recall that foldl must begin by combining the
    default accumulation value with the head (leftmost part) of the list and
    then combine that with the next elem, etc. Moving left -> right. (spoiler
    alert: answer below) 
    
    <div class="accordion" id="foldldef">
        <button class=" mb-0 btn btn-link" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapsefoldl">
          Show Answer
        </button>
    <div id="collapsefoldl" class="collapse" data-parent="#foldldef">
<pre ><code >foldl :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b 
foldl _ acc [] = acc 
foldl f acc (x:xs) = foldl f (f acc x) xs</code></pre>
            
    </div>
</div>
    
     <p>We have to pass the value
    from combining acc with the head of the list to pass to the next call to
    foldl. When there are no more things to combine, return the accumulated
    value. Now let's define foldr as well.</p>
     Excersie: Define foldr. Recall: <code>foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b</code> 
     Additionally recall that foldr must begin
    by combining the default accumulation value with the rightmost part of the
    list and then combine that with the element to its left, etc. Moving from
    right to left this time. 
    
    <div class="accordion" id="foldrdef">
        <button class=" mb-0 btn btn-link" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapsefoldr">
          Show Answer
        </button>
    <div id="collapsefoldr" class="collapse" data-parent="#foldrdef">
<pre ><code >foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b 
foldr _ acc [] = acc 
foldr f acc (x:xs) = f x (foldr f acc xs)</code></pre>
            
    </div>
</div>


     Ahah! We pass the
    untouched acc into the recursive call to foldr. In this way, the original
    acc value will end up all the way on the right side of the list before any
    combinations happen. To understand these definitions more, let's look at a
    simple step by step evaluation of <code>foldl (+) [1,2,3] 0</code> and 
    <code>foldr (+) [1,2,3] 0</code>. To do this, all we have to do is match the pattern and replace. repeat as
    necessary. 
<pre><code>foldl (+) 0 [1,2,3] -- matches: foldl  f acc (x: xs  ) = foldl  f  ( f acc x)  xs 
  =                 --          foldl (+) 0  (1:[2,3]) = foldl (+) ((+) 0  1) [2,3]
foldl (+) ((+) 0 1) [2,3] --rewrite (+) for readability 
  = 
foldl (+) (0 + 1) [2,3] -- matches: foldl  f   acc  (x: xs) = foldl ( f   acc  x)  xs 
  =                     --          foldl (+) (0+1) (2:[3]) = foldl ((+) (0+1) 2) [3]
foldl (+) ((+) (0 + 1) 2) [3] --rewrite (+) for readability 
  =
foldl (+) ((0 + 1) + 2) [3] -- matches: foldl  f     acc    (x:xs) = foldl ( f     acc    x) xs 
  =                         --          foldl (+) ((0+1)+2) (3:[]) = foldl ((+) ((0+1)+2) 3) []
foldl (+) ((+) ((0 + 1) + 2) 3) [] --rewrite (+) for readability 
  =
foldl (+) (((0 + 1) + 2) + 3) [] -- matches: foldl  _       acc      [] =     acc 
  =                              --          foldl (+) (((0+1)+2)+3) [] = (((0+1)+2)+3)
(((0 + 1) + 2) + 3) --full simplification 
  = 
6</code></pre>
    
    Now lets look at: <code>foldr (+) 0 [1,2,3]</code>
    <pre><code>
foldr (+) 0 [1,2,3] --matches: foldr  f acc (x:  xs ) =  f  x (foldr  f acc  xs ) 
  =                 --         foldr (+) 0  (1:[2,3]) = (+) 1 (foldr (+) 0 [2,3])   
(+) 1 (foldr (+) 0 [2,3]) -- applying (+) requires evaluation of second arg
  =
1 + (foldr (+) 0 [2,3]) -- the foldr portion matches:
                        -- foldr  f acc (x: xs) =  f  x (foldr  f acc xs ) 
                        -- foldr (+) 0  (2:[3]) = (+) 2 (foldr (+) 0 [0] )
  =
1 + ((+) 2 (foldr (+) 0 [3])) -- applying (+) requires evaluation of second arg 
  =
1 + (2 + (foldr (+) 0 [3])) -- foldr portion matches:
                            -- foldr  f acc (x:xs) =  f  x (foldr  f acc xs) 
                            -- foldr (+) 0  (3:[]) = (+) 3 (foldr (+) 0  [])
  =
1 + (2 + ((+) 3 (foldr (+) 0 []))) -- applying (+) requires evaluation of second arg
1 + (2 + (3 + (foldr (+) 0 []))    -- foldr portion matches base case:
                                   -- foldr  _ acc [] = acc 
                                   -- foldr (+) 0  [] = 0
  =
1 + (2 + (3 + (0)) --apply (+) as far as we can: full simplification 
  =
6</code></pre>
    <p>


    </p>
    <p>
      So they both ended up with the
      same value-- no surprises there, (+) is communitive. But as one might've guessed, we start
      combining left to right for foldl and we combined right to left in foldr
      (note the parenthesis in the near final expressions). For (+) it didn't
      matter, but think about what the results of: <code>foldl (-) 0 [1,2,3]</code> and 
      <code>foldr (-) 0 [1,2,3]</code> 
    </p>
    <p>
      -6 /= 2 !!! 
    </p>
    <p>
      You also may have noticed something strange but
      critically important to solving our riddle. Why didn't we evaluate any
      (+) expressions until the end? Well, it makes sense for the evaluation of foldr;
      The parenthesis made us expand foldr to get the value we were supposed to
      (+) first. We can't add 1 + (2 + x) until we know what x is because the
      bossy parenthesis says we have to do (2 + x) first.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why didn't we
      evaluate when we had the chance in the evaluation of foldl? I had everything I needed to 
      find out what <code>((0 + 1) + 2)</code> is, for example.
    </p>
    <p >
      Answer: HASKELL IS LAZY. By default, it won't compute anything unless absolutely necessary.
      It didn't know you would actually need that value yet, so instead of calculating
      it, it just remembered the work needed to get it. aka <code>((0 + 1) + 2)</code> 
      is what I'm supposed to do should anything down the line actually need this expression's value.  
      This is also refered to as a <b>thunk</b> -- remembering the steps to
      compute a value rather than the value. If you look closely throughout the
      evaluation of foldl, The addition thunk never <i>needs</i> to be evaluated until
      the statement: <code>(((0 + 1) + 2) + 3)</code> Which forces the evaluation because we're
      asking to please show the expression which stemmed all the
      way back from our initial ask of <code>foldl (+) 0 [1,2,3]</code>. 
      
    </p>
<p>
      Now to finally answer
      the question! let's look at the evaluation of something slightly larger.
      Recall sumUpTo':
  <pre ><code>sumUpTo' :: Int -> Int 
  sumUpTo' n = let listOfSums = foldr (\x acc -> sum [0..x] : acc ) [] [0..] in 
      listofSums !! n
  </code>
  </pre>

</p>

Let's evaluate the
    expression: <code>sumUpTo' 1</code>:
<pre><code>
sumUpTo' 1 --matches our one pattern to become: 
  =
let listOfSums = foldr (\x acc -> sum [0..x] : acc) [] [0..] in listofSums !! 1
</code></pre> 
    <p>
      So Haskell, being as lazy as it can get away with, sees that you are
      accessing index 1 of <code>listOfSums</code>. So it will do ONLY the work
      necessary to do that. aka the first 2 elements of listOfSums. To keep things a little
      shorter lets say: <code>f = (\x acc -> sum [0..x] : acc)</code>
      
    </p>
    <p>Computing sumUpTo only far enough to get the first 2 elements:</p>
<pre><code>listOfSums 
  = 
foldr (\x acc -> sum [0..x] : acc) [] [0..]
  =
foldr f [] [0..] --the pattern we match requires we know if 
                 --[0..] if empty or not. So we evaluate [0..] 
                 --just far enough to know if it's [].
  =
foldr f [] (0:[1..]) -- matches foldr pattern: 
                     -- foldr f acc (x:  xs ) = f x (foldr f acc  xs ) 
                     -- foldr f  [] (0:[1..]) = f 0 (foldr f [] [1..])
f 0
    (foldr f [] [1..]) f 0 (foldr f [] [1..]) --remember because we're lazy, we
    don't need to evalute the arguements to f, we can apply f NOW. If we end up
    needing the args, we'll get them then. --replacing f (\x acc -> sum [0..x] :
    acc) 0 (foldr f [] [1..]) --function application (twice technically thanks
    to currying) sum [0..0] : (foldr f [] [1..])) sum [0] : (foldr f [] [1..]))
    0 : (foldr f [] [1..])) --ahah! I have the first element of the list. But I
    have to keep going. I need first first 2, bare minimum --compute the head of
    [1..] because foldr uses it. I am forced to evaluate it. But no more work
    than that will I do! 0 : (foldr f [] 1:[2..])) --matched foldr pattern.
    replace. 0 : (f 1 (foldr [] [2..])) --again, I have 2 args for f and can
    apply it. --replacing f: 0 : ((\x acc -> sum [0..x] : acc) 1 (foldr []
    [2..])) --applying 0 : (sum [0..1] : (foldr [] [2..])) --list expansiopn 0 :
    (sum [0,1] : (foldr [] [2..])) --sum 0 : (1 : (foldr [] [2..])) --STOP!!!!!!
    why? I have all I need now to compute: 0 : (1 : (foldr [] [2..])) !! 1 1
</code></pre>
     Now
    let's look at what would happen if we defined listOfSums using foldl:
    listOfSums = foldl (\x acc -> sum [0..x] : acc) [] [0..] Again, we would
    only need to compute the first 2 elements of listOfSums. foldl (\x acc ->
    sum [0..x] : acc) [] [0..] --let's again say f = (\x acc -> sum [0..x] :
    acc) for brevity. foldl f [] [0..] -- matches pattern: foldl f acc (x:xs) =
    foldl f (f acc x) xs when expaned slightly foldl f [] (0:[1..]) --pattern
    replace foldl f (f [] 0) [1..] --we evaluate foldl again matching the same
    pattern. foldl f (f [] 0) [1..] -- [1..] is expanded by 1 to match the
    pattern for foldl again. foldl f (f [] 0) (1:[2..]) --pattern replace foldl
    f (f (f [] 0) 1) [2..] --starting to not look so good.. expand [2..] by 1 to
    match pattern definition for foldl. foldl f (f (f [] 0) 1) (2:[3..])
    --pattern replace foldl f (f (f (f [] 0) 1) 2 [3..] --see what the problem
    is? I can't reach the base case for the foldl pattern until the list is
    empty: foldl _ acc [] = acc -- unfortunately, moving through the list [3..]
    as we have been will never become empty. We will never reach the end or our
    base case! conclusion: Should you ever require to fold an infinte list, you
    know the right way to go. -}
